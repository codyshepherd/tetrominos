This program requires Java 8 installed to compile. For some reason, the linuxlab machines have the
experimental OpenJDK Java 9 set by default. This program will compile and run on the linuxlab if you take
the following steps.

1. Enable Java 8 on linux by running `addpkg` at the command line and selecting Java 8 in the ensuing GUI.

2. `cd` to the top level of this project.
    i.e., `ls` should show this file, the Makefile, the writeup, and directories src and tests

3. to compile, execute makefile with `make`
    This will put compiled binaries in [working directory]/out 

4. run the binary with the following command:
    `scala -cp [working directory]/out Program`

Appropriately formatted text files can be piped into this program, e.g.:

    `cat tests/test1-in.txt | scala -cp [working directory]/out Program`
