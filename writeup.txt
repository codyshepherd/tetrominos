Writeup Project 1: Tetrominos

My solution for this project was relatively "safe" and straightforward. I used a 2-D array of Cell objects to
represent the board. I chose to use objects to allow me to track the state of the board in a more fine-grained
manner than booleans, numbers, or characters, with the goals of facilitating some quicker checks, as well as
improving correctness and having fewer runtime bugs through use of types and Scala's type system.

The other big choice I made was to build the possible rotational orientations of a given tile into the class of
the tile itself, as an iterator. Orientations are defined as a list of four Pairs, i.e. grid coordinates.
This allowed me to view each cell occupied by a tile as an offset from a given grid location, and made looping
over rotations much simpler.

I treated a given set of tiles as a Bag, i.e. they could be applied in any order. One can see in the code that, if
necessary, the program will run over every possible permutation. I am not actually sure if the Scala implementation
of list permutations will detect isomorphisms and optimize those out or not.

See code documentation for a more detailed description of code.
